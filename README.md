# Frogger Clone Project

This is an assignment for the Udacity Front-end Advanced Nanodegree, a memory game done using the HTML/CSS and JavaScript. This was made using HTML Canvas and Object Oriented JavaScript.


I used the base code provided by Udacity, a basic HTML/CSS, an engine (engine.js), and an image loading utility (resources.js).
